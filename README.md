# python-challenge
This is an assignment from Bootcamp. In this challenge there are two scripts that analyze the financial record of a company. I practiced pandas and organizing code into functions, to prepare for harder lessons with pandas. 

The finished code is currently working in the main.py file, but will continue to practice with the pandas and functions.

The data will be from a csv and will be composed of two columns of data.

In the other csv there will be a vote counting csv.
